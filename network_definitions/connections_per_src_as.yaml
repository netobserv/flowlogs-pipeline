description:
  This metric counts network connections per source Autonomous System (AS)
details:
  Aggregates flow records by values of "SrcAS" field and counts the number of entries in each aggregate with non zero value
usage:
  Evaluate amount of connections initiated by different Autonomous Systems
labels:
  - rate
  - count
  - AS
